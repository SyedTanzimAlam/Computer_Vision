# VisionForge Console


A Next.js + Tailwind recreation of the Shadcn Admin create-account experience tailored for the fictional VisionForge computer vision platform. The project runs on the Bun runtime and mirrors the UI patterns from [satnaing/shadcn-admin](https://github.com/satnaing/shadcn-admin).

## Features

- **Shadcn-inspired layout:** Centered brand header, rounded card, and clean typography matching the reference design.
- **Client-side validation:** Email, password length, and confirmation checks with inline success or error feedback.
- **Social sign-in placeholders:** GitHub and Facebook buttons with status messaging ready for integration.

## Tech stack

- **Framework:** Next.js 15 with the App Router
- **Runtime & package manager:** Bun 1.2+
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v4 utilities via `@import "tailwindcss"`
- **TypeScript:** Strict configuration with the modern JSX runtime

## Getting started

Install dependencies:


```bash
bun install
```


Run the development server:


```bash
